# Mark Kump Individual Project
This is the repository for the individual project, Hollywood In Repose

### Problem Statement

While researching celebrity deaths for a conversation I was having with my girlfriend, I noticed that every celebrity obituary tracker I came across either contained user interfaces that lacked intuitiveness or filters to that didn't meet my requirements. 
The application, Hollywood in Repose, will provide a modern UI that gives the user the ability to search deceased celebrities with more options than current celebrity obituary trackers. Once a celebrity is searched, the application will return a celebritie's: Image,
DOB, DOD, notable works, and a link to their IMDB page where applicable.
